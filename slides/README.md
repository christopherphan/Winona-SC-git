# Slide show

This is the main LaTeX Beamer presentation used at the workshop. However, most of the lesson was not in the presentation, but consisted of the instructor using the command line directly.

For the lesson plans, see: <http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/>

Some of the SVG files from the lesson plans were converted to TikZ using Inkscape.
